### Core idea of the project:
# Name: Sitters.
# Concept: It's a website + app to connect parents and/or pet owners with sitters. 


### Features: 
users [sitters and paretns / owners, pets in general also]
they all have some profile 
Parents / owners they can search for some sitters available and book a service
Parents / owners can see based on location where are the sitters available
sitters can also see where doggo or baby is
show available sitters based also on different attributes -> to be defined later 
Profiles have a review system (rating like some stars) 
Users (parent or sitter) can also switch profile to be a sitter/owner time to time
login verification to be done -> some authentication (facebook, google, email or something else?)




Our website is meant to connect people who require Sitter services for animals, children...and plants if they have no friends.  At face level, the site will function much like Reddit or Facebook, but will allow owners & parents to post 'Sitter Requests'. Requests will be searchable, so 
that Sitters can locate requests that will fit their availabilities.  Owners/parents will have the ability to check a verified profile for the sitter. 

In phase one, we'll just allow Clients to post requests for Sitters, after which Sitters can find and apply for those requests, which will need to be accepted by
the Clients. 

In phase two, Sitters will be able to manage/display their availabilities, and Clients can book their time directly.
